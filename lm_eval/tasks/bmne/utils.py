"""
BMNE task utilities.

This task evaluates gender bias in language models using two datasets:
1. CrowS-Pairs subset: 186 examples across 4 categories
2. StereoSet subset: 223 examples across 4 categories

Both datasets use the CrowS-Pairs format with sentence pairs where one represents
a stereotypical view and the other represents an anti-stereotypical view.

The bias score is calculated as the percentage of times the model prefers the
stereotypical sentence over the anti-stereotypical sentence. A score of 50%
indicates no bias (random choice), while scores significantly above 50% indicate
bias towards stereotypes.
